# SuperCollider-Sound-track-
A composition I made in SuperCollider which are based on sounds that are present in Mutations by Jean Clause Risset. I recreated the sounds in the track to make them sound like a bassoon or clarinet and built upon techniques like Amplitude and Frequency Modulation and modulating the gain along with the carrier frequency to create a brand new track.
